These dislocations are often associated with osteochondral fractures. To the best of our knowledge, isolated dorsal midtarsal dislocation owing to plantarflexion of the forefoot on the hindfoot with the ankle in a neutral or dorsiflexed position is rare. In this article, we describe a case of isolated Chopart's dorsal dislocation and discuss the mechanism of injury, management, and outcome. The patient was treated with open reduction and repair of ligamentous structures, and Kirschner wire transfixation. At approximately 96 weeks following treatment, the patient was walking without aid, despite the development of posttraumatic degenerative changes at the calcaneocuboid joint. In retrospect, primary arthrodesis of the calcaneocuboid joint may have been more beneficial for the patient. We also describe the unusual mechanism whereby a plantarflexory force applied to the forefoot, without ankle plantarflexion, results in dorsal dislocation of the midtarsal joint.

Is it possible to express Cobb angle in such a way that it could be visualized as a length, especially while planning for surgical correction of scoliosis?
{METHODS}: Thirty consecutive patients below the age of 19 years with a scoliosis of Cobb angle more than 10 degrees were included in the study. Convexo-concave vertebral difference of the structural curve was measured. Its relationship with the measure of Cobb angle was studied.
{RESULTS}: Author obtained a significant linear correlation between the convexo-concave vertebral differences and the Cobb angle. Using the formula Y=2d.Sin (X/2) the convexo-concave vertebral difference could be predicted. The difference thus obtained gives a quantitative measure of the maximum length of correction possible in the structural curve.
{CONCLUSION}: It is possible to express the Cobb angle as a function of linear measurement. The author proposes that this would aid the surgeons to accurately and predictably achieve the desired scoliosis correction.},

However, the neurovascular and muscular anatomy in the proximity of the humerus precludes the use of a "safe" extensive approach. We here present a new technique for extensive exposure of the proximal humerus and shoulder for wide resection of tumors. By reflecting the deltoid with its origin as an osteomyocutaneous flap downwards and backwards, the entire shoulder, including the rotator cuff and proximal humerus, are exposed with minimal damage to the blood supply and function of the deltoid muscle. This approach, which is a logical combination of anterior, transacromial and deltoid splitting approaches, was used in 17 patients, 11 achieving satisfactory functional results. Our new surgical approach reduces intraoperative damage to the blood supply of the deltoid and results in better function of the shoulder postoperatively because both the powerful intermediate muscle fibers of the deltoid and its acromial origin remain intact.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To test the significance of calcar referenced tip-apex distance ({CalTAD}) and the length of anti-rotation screw ({AR} screw) as predictors for failure after biaxial cephalomedullary ({CM}) nailing of intertrochanteric fractures.
{METHODS}: We retrospectively reviewed 190 consecutive fractures that had undergone biaxial {CM} nailing. Of these, 67 met the inclusion criteria of a non-pathological fracture with a minimum of 90 days radiological follow-up (mean 458 days; 91 days to 4.9 years).
{RESULTS}: The overall failure rate was 15\% (10 of 67). Failure was associated with a higher {CalTAD} in most of the patients (13\%, p {\textless} 0.001). A higher tip-apex distance ({TAD}) was not significantly associated with failure ( p = 0.132), when the {CalTAD} was less than 25 mm. When the {AR} screw length exceeded a line connecting the tip of the nail and the lag screw, screw cutout occurred only in one patient ( p = 0.095).
{CONCLUSION}: Our data provide the first reported clinical evidence that the {CalTAD} is a better predictor of cutout in biaxial {CM} nailing than {TAD} measurement. However, the length of anti-rotational element does not seem to be an independent predictor of {CM} nailing failure.},

	abstract = {Gorham's disease, or massive osteolysis, is a rare condition characterized by the spontaneous onset of osteolysis in an otherwise healthy individual. Such osteolysis is related to localized endothelial proliferation of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiomatous osteolysis) resulting in destruction and absorption of bone, and is commonly thought to affect primarily cancellous bone. In this article, we describe a case of Gorham's disease involving the fibula in a 13-year-old boy with a 2-year history of pain and a 1-year history of muscle atrophy. The patient was treated with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, and a period of immobilization. At the 3-year follow-up visit, the patient was ambulating without restrictions, although he experienced occasional episodes of pain and swelling localized to the left ankle; and follow-up radiographs revealed no further progression of the disease. Current literature suggests that the fibula, being primarily cortical bone, is not likely to be affected by Gorham's disease and that fibular grafts may be used in the treatment of the disorder. However, since this case depicts the disorder localizing to the distal fibula, we believe further studies are needed to validate the usefulness of fibular grafts in the treatment of the condition. Because the course of the disease is unpredictable and may arrest spontaneously, and based on the results observed in the patient described in this article, conservative treatment may be appropriate for Gorham's disease localized to the distal fibula.

{METHODS}: Curettage and bone grafting after {CT} classification was performed in 31 patients and curettage and bone grafting without {CT} classification in 20. The surgical approach for curettage in the {CT} classified group of patients was through the site of the cortical break, irrespective of the standard approach to the particular region of bone involved. The aim of this approach was to achieve wide excision of the possibly involved soft tissue.
{RESULTS}: At similar duration of follow up (72 months) in patients with a similar mean age (33 years), Musculoskeletal Tumor Society ({MSTS}) scores for {CT} classified patients were similar to those of patients who had undergone standard curettage. However, the postoperative recurrence rate in the {CT} classified group was significantly less (12.9\%) than in the non-{CT} classified group.
{CONCLUSION}: A {CT} based selection strategy is a valid preoperative tool for evaluation of giant cell tumor. Further, for curettage these lesions are better approached through the site of cortical break, irrespective of standard approaches, so that adequate soft tissue clearance can be achieved.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {CONTEXT}: Epithelioid angiosarcoma ({EA}) is a high-grade sarcoma of vascular origin. {EA} is a rare variant of angiosarcoma. It is characterized by large cells with an epethelioid morphology. {EA} has been reported in sites like skin thyroid, adrenal gland, soft tissue, and rarely in bone.
{PURPOSE}: The current article describes a case of multicentric {EA} of the spine that presented simultaneously at T4 spine and the posterior one third of the left fourth rib. {STUDY} {DESIGN}/{SETTINGS}: This study included a patient with a rare spinal tumor, which presented insidiously. Radiologically, the lesions were osteolytic with erosion of cortices. The tumor was composed of nests and cords of malignant cells with epithelioid morphology with areas of vascular differentiation, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Anastomosing vascular spaces lined by epithelioid endothelial cells suggested focal endotheliod differentiation.
{METHODS}: Histopathological evaluation of the tumor obtained from en bloc resection of the fourth rib and specimen from decompression of the fourth thoracic vertebra was done. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for endothelioid cell markers like {CD}31 and factor {VIII} related antigen. The authors point out the need for immunohistochemical evaluation after careful histological analysis for vascular differentiation for an accurate diagnosis of vascular bone tumors with epithelioid features so that an erroneous diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma can be avoided. {EA} occurs rarely in bone. {EA} is marked by the presence of large polygonal epithelioid malignant cells with marked cellular atypia and pleomorphism. The arrangement of the cells may mimic epithelial neoplasm. These types of lesions are a definite diagnostic challenge in bone biopsy. The tumor was treated with en bloc resection of the rib and decompression of the body of T4 spine, followed by megavoltage radiotherapy. Follow-up X-rays showed regression of the tumor at 2 years. {CD}31 is the most sensitive marker for {EA}. Even in the absence of obvious vascular differentiation, abundant intratumoral hemorrhage and intratumoral neutrophils are definite morphologic changes that should suggest a vascular origin.
{RESULTS}: The patient was followed up for 2 years. A conservative surgical approach with a radical course of megavoltage radiotherapy could yield a good result in {EA} of bone. At the time of writing this report, there is no evidence of tumor recurrence.
{CONCLUSION}: It is important to differentiate {EA} from other tumors because the clinical course and treatment are specific for these conditions. Careful histologic and immunohistochemical analysis will clinch the diagnosis. Even though rare, we stress the importance to be aware of the existence of this tumor, which is essential for correct diagnosis.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: More students are posted in the orthopaedic out-patient departments than before. Lack of clinical space to accommodate students is a frequently cited problem. Virtual learning allows for an adjustable location and is scalable. We aimed to compare both the effectiveness and student satisfaction level between onsite virtual classroom and physical classroom in teaching orthopaedics to a group of undergraduate medical students. Methods: A quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design study was conducted with 49 final-year medical students participating in orthopaedic training between November 2019 to January 2020. These students were randomly allocated into two groups, experimental (virtual classroom) and comparison (physical learning). The experimental group received an onsite virtual learning environment, whereas the control group received the same content in a physical classroom. Pre and post-tests that consisted of multiple choice questions were administered. At the end of the class, the students completed a 5-point Likert scale satisfaction level evaluation questionnaire. Results: The post-test knowledge scores between virtual classroom (M=78.2,{SD}=12.74) and Physical classroom (M=77.92,{SD}=10.31) were not different (z= 0.00, p=1.00). Though the overall perceptions of learning were positive, some frustrations were apparent and the student satisfaction was significantly better (z=-4.60, p value=0.00) with the physical classroom (M=3.83,{SD}=0.16) compared to virtual classroom (M=3.5,{SD}=0.23). Conclusions: Onsite virtual activities are not as satisfying as physical classroom in the opinion of the students, but they are successful strategies in learning that can be used in outpatient orthopaedic clinics to address the problem of lack of space. Students learn content focused on orthopaedic clinical learning objectives as well using onsite virtual classroom as they do in the traditional classroom setting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Rationale Competency-based medical education ({CBME}) has gained momentum as an improved training model, but literature on outcomes of {CBME}, including evaluation of implementation processes, is minimal. We present a case for the following: (a) the development of a program theory is essential prior to or in the initial stages of implementation of {CBME}; (b) the program theory should guide the strategies and methods for evaluation that will answer questions about anticipated and unintended outcomes; and (c) the iterative process of testing assumptions and hypotheses will lead to modifications to the program theory to inform best practices of implementing {CBME}. Methods We use the Triple C Competency-based Curriculum as a worked example to illustrate how process and outcome evaluation, guided by a program theory, can lead to meaningful enhancement of {CBME} curriculum, assessment, and implementation strategies. Using a mixed methods design, the processes and outcomes of Triple C were explored through surveys, interviews, and historical document review, which captured the experiences of various stakeholders. Findings The theory-led program evaluation process was able to identify areas that supported {CBME} implementation: the value of a strong nondirective national vertical core supporting the transformation in education, program autonomy, and adaptability to pre-existing local context. Areas in need of improvement included the need for ongoing support from College of Family Physicians of Canada ({CFPC}) and better planning for shifts in program leadership over time. Conclusions Deliberately pairing evaluation alongside change is an important activity and, when accomplished, yields valuable information from the experiences of those implementing and experiencing a program. Evaluation and the development of an updated program theory facilitate the introduction of new changes and theories that build on these findings, which also supports the desired goal of contributing toward cumulative science rather than “reinventing the wheel.”},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives:
In compliance with {MCI}'s recommendation, a month-long Foundation Course was conducted in our institution in Aug’19. The present study was conducted to seek the opinion of the students and faculty regarding relevance of the topics included in the course to enable revisions to be made in designing the course for the subsequent sessions, to make it more effective and student-oriented.

Methods:
A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted to seek the opinion of 100 students who underwent the Foundation Course and 35 faculty members who were involved in teaching the topics allotted.

Results:
Positive feedback was recorded from63\% of the students and 69\% of the faculty regarding the overall experience of the course. Among the different modules, Skills module was voted as relevant by majority (73\%) of students, whereas a module on Enhancement of Language and Computer Skills was found relevant to the course by a mere 52\% students. In contrast, module on Sports and Extracurricular activities was adjudged as most relevant while as module on Enhancement of Language and Computer Skills got the least positive feedback (81.43\% vs. 60.36\%, respectively) from the faculty.

Interpretation and Conclusions:
Foundation Course recommended by {MCI} for {MBBS} students at the entry level is a welcome step. This can further be made more beneficial by making necessary modifications in the planning of the course in light of suggestions received from the participants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many faculties of medicine now include programmes using early clinical exposure (ECE) to introduce medical students to important topics in medicine. OBJECTIVE: To sketch the landscape of ECE in Europe, describing existing courses. METHODS: A survey questionnaire was developed by the Basic Medical Education Committee of the European Academy of Teachers in General Practice (EURACT). This survey used the key informant interviews method, with EURACT Council members serving as key informants by filling in the questionnaire and gathering descriptive data on ECE programmes in their own countries. RESULTS: We asked representatives of 32 EURACT member countries to complete the questionnaire in 2006. We received responses from 21 countries, and the programmes of 40 medical schools from 16 countries were included in the study. Thirty-two medical schools implemented ECE starting in the first year. The duration of ECE programmes ranged from 2 weeks to 2 years. The length of each session varied from 2 hours to a full day. Primary care played an important role in ECE. ECE programmes were implemented with a wide range of objectives. CONCLUSION: ECE is a new and rewarding trend in European medical schools, and general practice/family medicine (GP/FM) departments are widely involved in these teaching activities. This could help establish GP/FM departments in some countries that still do not have them in their medical schools.},
