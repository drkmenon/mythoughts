<p>Assume that we have a normally distributed population of males and females with a mean height of 168cms and 158cms respectively.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1)
m=rnorm(100,168,5)
f=rnorm(100,158,5)
mf=as.data.frame(m,f)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>boxplot(m,f)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>htdif=mean(m)-mean(f)
round(htdif,digits = 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10.7</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the mean difference in the height is 10.7 cms.<br />
<strong>If I measure the entire population in the world, will I find that the mean height for each sex is different?</strong> or<br />
<strong>would I find that difference between the mean height is zero?</strong></p>

<h3>Frequentist method</h3>
<p>Assume a hypothetical world with no difference in the height between the sexes.Do repeated experiments and find out what <code>proportion of times</code> would I obtain a difference between the observed means(ø) in that hypothetical world which is as great as or greater than difference I observed in my real experiment.
<strong>This proportion of time is abbreviated as <em>p-value</em> </strong></p>
<p>In other words <em>p-value</em>=P(ø/H), given the null(H), what is the probability of data(ø)</p>
<p>but <em>p-value</em> is an answer to a question we didn’t intend to ask. So what to do with it?</p>

<h2>Fisher’s view:</h2>
<p>Treat it as a measure of strength of evidence. This is not objectively satisfactory because, <em>p-value</em>=P(ø/H)≠P(H/ø)</p>

<div id="neyman-pearson-decision-framework" class="section level2">
<h2>Neyman-Pearson decision framework</h2>
<p>In each experiment, if you need to choose between the Null and the alternative, then there is possibility for two types of errors</p>
<p>False Positive: Choosing the alternative when Null is true
False Negative: Choosing the Null when the alternative is true</p>
<p><strong>Control the rate at which you commit decision errors of false positive type by applying a strict procedure to each expiriment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <em>p-value</em></li>
<li>Choose the Null if <em>p-value</em> is &gt; α</li>
<li>Choose the alternative if <em>p-value</em> is &lt;= α</li>
<li>Typically α is set at 0.05</li>
</ul>

<div id="confidence-interval" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval</h2>
<p>Under repeated sampling in hypothetical world, 95% of confidence intervals constructed the same way will include the true value of the mean difference.</p>
